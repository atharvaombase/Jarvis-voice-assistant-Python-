Jarvis Voice Assistant
Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based project aimed at creating a voice-controlled assistant similar to Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.

Functionality
Voice Recognition: Jarvis utilizes speech recognition to understand user commands.
Command Execution: It executes various commands based on user input, such as checking the weather, playing music, setting reminders, etc.
Customizable Responses: You can customize Jarvis's responses and add new functionalities according to your needs.
Modular Design: The project is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and maintain.

Possible tasks:-
1.Open any app present on the system.
2.Open some common website like Youtube and Wikipedia.
3.You can make it search youtube video it won't start playing but it will search for the video on the youtube and show you the results.(say search on youtube,then jarvis will ask what to search ,you can again say the video name you want to search and it will redirect you to chrome and open youtube with the name already searched on it.)
4.We can set timer and continue to give another tasks ,timer will ring when the timer is up (Multithreading is getting used in the timer code for continueing the work while timer counts the time.)
5.We can make it search on wikipedia it will seach on wikipedia and read the first 5 lines,You can change this in the code by changing the 5 value to any value you want.
6.There is very big scope for api in this project as we just tell it to fetch the data and read out loud.

Start Interacting:
Once the program is running, Jarvis will prompt you to speak. Simply speak your command, and Jarvis will respond accordingly.
There is a login page that stores the login credentials at the database so you can create your own and proceed with the project or just drop the login part and open Newjarvis.py file and start running the code.
There are some bugs that i am unable to solve so you can solve those and add some more funtionality as per yout need.

Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation, feel free to open a pull request.
More api's can be added ,Funtions can become more refined,there is lots of work to do if someone wants to.
